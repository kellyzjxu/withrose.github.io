        <p>Hello! We are Hana and Kelly. We became friends back in high school; many impulsive decisions, ditch days, 
            and commiserate-over-boys sessions later, we are still close friends.<br>
        Now that we no longer go to the same school, we wanted to find a project to work on together - and thus, With Ros&eacute was born.
            We are hoping to use this website to share our love for fashion, our college adventures, and our random late night thoughts.
        We decided to write the code from scratch to work on our HTML/CSS skills, so please let us know if you notice any bugs!<br>
            Thank you, and we hope you enjoy :)<br></p>
        <p> A little bit more about us as individuals</p>    
        <p>
            I'm Hana, Computer Science major at Columbia University. <br>
            Apparently I left the Silicon Valley, but it didn't leave me...<br>
            Ironic, since I hadn't really coded before coming to college.<br>
            I am currently spending the majority of my time in college missing my dog, Nami (yes she is adorable no you can't have her), 
            and wishing I had enough time and money to explore all of the different parts of New York City (oh Brooklyn why are you so far away from me and my heart).<br>
            <br>Thank you for coming along for the ride!
            <br></p>
        <br>
        <p>Hey! I'm Kelly, and I study Econ and Computer Science at Cornell University.
            <br>I've always had a love for exploring, and this blog is perfect for sharing that.
            <br>Follow along for some fun, friendship, and fashion!
            <br></p>
