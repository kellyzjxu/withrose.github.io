            <h1>Some Thoughts</h1>
			<p>by: Hana</p>
            <p>Spring break is upon us, but really, it's a "spring" break. The weather has been pretty nice until my friend
			Audrey, from Amherst, came to visit. We got hit by a blizzard today, but it hasn't been <i>too</i> bad - aside
			from the huge L from trying to walk to Starbucks with snow painfully hitting our faces, only to find that my
			computer was at 7% and there were no outlets there (but really Starbucks?!). </p>
            <p>Last night, we hit up some jazz clubs: Fat Cat, which I've been wanting to go to forever, but it ended up being
			a complete flop (but would definitely go again to play some pool). And Smalls, which completely changed my life. </p>
			<p>Jazz. I still don't quite fully undertand it, but the musicians listen to each other and to themselves in a way
			that is completely genuine - something that I feel is, sadly, lacking oftentimes in classical music. Especially with
			musicians in high school, middle school, and even younger (Juilliard PreCollege I'm looking at you). </p>
			<p>Afterwards, I rewatched La La Land with a friend. That opening scene will never <i>not</i> be magical.</p>
            <p>Audrey and I also stopped by MoMA during the day. Bitter sweet, because I'm now a complete MoMA enthusiast, sorry
			Met :) I would love to have a home that's built like the MoMA - where it is not only decorated by a lot of art work,
			but the building structure itself is also a work of art. </p>
            <p>Anyways, I've spent a considerable amount of time over these past 24 hours making this website come to life,
			and I know that it's a complete "waste" of my time, with Physics midterm and a problem set due on Monday. But I have
			never felt this happy to be working on a project! But for now.. back to Physics!</p>
